\section{Introduction}
\wrm{goldilocks argument}

There is widespread belief that the foundations of distributed data management
are a poor fit to popular new platforms for distributed
computing~\cite{ladis}. Classical protocols for transactional atomicity and
distributed consensus rely on timely messaging. But typical modern platforms
consist of thousands of machines in datacenters spread across the world and
exhibit relatively frequent message delays and component failures.  As a result,
many programmers today avoid classical protocols and attempt to build
applications that operate correctly using only loose notions of data
consistency.  While there are software engineering patterns to inform this
process~\cite{quicksand}, there is a need for formal tools to help programmers
reason about distributed data management at the application level.

In recent years there has been revived interest in logic programming as a framework for developing distributed systems (e.g.,~\cite{reactors,boom}).  This has led in turn to optimism about using database theory as a foundation for modeling key correctness issues in distributed programs~\cite{declarative-imperative}.
In this paper we report concrete progress on this front.  

Utilizing a model-theoretic framework for analyzing distributed programs, we demonstrate the undecidability of tests for two key properties of distributed programs: confluence in the face of message delays and reordering, and eventual consistency of replicas.  We then use the same framework to derive a number of constructive results that follow from earlier conjectures~\cite{declarative-imperative}.
First, we demonstrate that distributed programs satisfying a broad definition of  monotonicity are guaranteed to be confluent, producing consistent results in the face of arbitrary message delays and reordering.  We then turn our attention to non-monotonic programs, and provide a generic construction for distributed coordination that guarantees adherence to a natural semantic interpretation.  Finally, we show how to guarantee the eventual consistency of distributed replicas by rewriting programs with a simple generic protocol for data replication.

To connect these results to traditional imperative models of distributed programming, we provide a mapping from our logical framework to a more traditional state-machine model.  In concurrent work we have also used these results directly, to develop practical software analysis tools for distributed logic programming~\cite{cidr11}.  

\subsection{Organization}
In Section~\ref{sec:foundation} we introduce \lang, the distributed logic programming language that we use throughout the paper.  Section~\ref{sec:operational} presents an operational interpretation of a distributed system, and proves a correspondence between \lang models and operational behavior.  We present our confluence results in section~\ref{sec:confluence}, and in Section~\ref{sec:consistency} we examine the issue of replica consistency.  We conclude with a discussion of related and future work (Sections~\ref{sec:relwork} and~\ref{sec:conclusion}).

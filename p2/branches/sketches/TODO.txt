 - A TCP connect element pair: analogous to UDP element.  Some kind of
   reconnection policy.   Rx is push output, Tx is pull input. 

 - Element to demultiplex packets based on peer IP address.  push-in,
   push-out. 

 - Add a persistent table object, using BerkeleyDB or Rusty's
   transactional store.

 - Adding microbenchmarks to the framework above.

 - Cron job to checkout a fresh tree on grumpy each night, build P2,
   run all the regression tests, archive the benchmark timings, and
   send any errors to p2devel. 

 - Message-level simulation

 - Autoconf should check for correct version of flex 

 - Autoconf should check for correct version of bison

 - Dynamic or static schema checker. Do all instances of foo(X, Y, Z) in
   your OverLog use the same arity, types?

 - Create an AND barrier.  It has a variable number of push inputs and a
   push output.  It remembers inputs it receives until it is
   reset. Waits until all received inputs have received a tuple with
   "true".  When all have received true inputs, it pushes out a signal
   tuple on its output port and resets all input ports to false.

 - Add a "getting started with P2" document (Joe)

 - Rewrite OverLog parser, fix off-by-one errors in error reporting,
   engineer a consistent error handling policy.

 - Write an OverLog manual. (Joe)

 - Use shared pointers (or a materialized version thereof) to implement
   the count algorithm for multiply-derived tuples.

 - Create a uniform logging infrastructure that can be used outside of
   the dataflow, especially for logging within tables and other non-data
   flow components.

 - Create a replay facility for element, rule strand, and dataflow
   traces. Great for replay debugging.

 - Fix docs/ping.olg

  * DESCRIPTION: OverLog test for tables without a key, in which tuples
  * are indexed by their identifier.

  * Run me as follows:
  *
  * tests/runOverLog -o unitTests/olg/keyLessTable.olg
  *
  * Every second for five iterations, a new keyLess tuple should be produced with an
  * increasing count.

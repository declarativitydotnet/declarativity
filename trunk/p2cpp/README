This directory contains the C++ interface to P2. This interface provides
four main functions. The first is starting up a P2 instance and instantiating
a stub dataflow. The second is installing overlog programs into the running
system. The third is registering callbacks to arbitrary C++ functions upon
receipt of a particular tuple. Finally, the C++ interface provides a way for
an application to inject tuples into the running P2 instance. 

The interface to this functionality is located in p2.h, defined by the
P2 class. Creating an instance of a P2 class requires a hostname or ip
address, and a port number. The P2 instance will send and receive tuples
over UDP on this address and port. The transport layer provides no congestion
control, reliable delivery, or ordered delivery. Transport layer customization, 
including prior mentioned options, will be supported in future releases. If
you require the use of TCP like functionality you will need to modify the 
transport layer dataflow script in p2.C to include the desired transport layer
elements. For assistance with this please post questions to p2devel@yahoogroups.com.

The test files runPingPong.C and runOverLog2.C, found in the '/tests' directory,
make use of the C++ interface. In runPingPong.C, the code reads in the overlog
for the 'pingpong.olg' program (found in the '/doc' directory), installs it into
the P2 instance, and registers a callback that prints the first ping tuple,
immediately unregisters the callback and pushes a "test" tuple into P2. When
the test callback is called the ping callback is again registered, and the 
process repeats. The runOverLog2.C test is a more general purpose test, which
follows the functionality of runOverLog.C but contains much less code. The 
test reads in an arbitrary overlog program and installs it in the P2 instance.
It also registers echo callbacks to tuple names given in the '-w' command line
argument(s). Finally, before installing the overlog program it will run the C
pre-processor on the overlog text, passing any environment variables given
in the '-D' command line argument(s). 

On a final note, the C++ interface makes use of the P2 Python library. You will
need to ensure that your PYTHONPATH variable is defined properly. Please see
the README file in 'python/p2' for further details regarding environment setup.
